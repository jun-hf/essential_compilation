## Definition intrepreter
A definition intrepreter define exactly how does your language evaulate. 

In order to prove that your compiler works, in this case we use a TypeScript compiler.

A TypeScript Program, P_(TypeScript) that uses the TypeScript compiler to compile to JavaScript Program P_JavaScript

DL_TypeScript(i) -> o
DL_JavaScript(i) -> o 

Using the definition intrepreter of each language, with the same input, it must evaulate to the same output.
